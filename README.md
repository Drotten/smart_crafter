Smart Crafter
===

This mod will make your crafting life somewhat easier. Basically what it does is to make your crafters think a bit by themselves and craft all the necessary ingredients (if able, of course) to get that one item you want. For example, when wanting to craft a weapon, your blacksmith will first of all make all the ingots necessary for that weapon, before crafting the weapon itself.

Your crafters also communicate between each other. So when your carpenter needs a bolt of cloth, your weaver will craft one.

Happy crafting!
