Smart Crafter
===

This mod will make your crafting life somewhat easier. Basically what it does is to make your crafters think a bit by themselves and craft all the necessary ingredients (if able, of course) to get that one item you want. For example, when wanting to craft a weapon, your blacksmith will first of all make all the ingots necessary for that weapon, before crafting the weapon itself.

Your crafters also communicate with each other. So when a carpenter needs a bolt of cloth, a weaver will make one.

Happy crafting!
