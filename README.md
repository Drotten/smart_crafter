Smart Crafter
===

This small mod makes your crafting life a bit easier. Basically what it does is to make your crafters smarter and craft all the necessary stuff to get that one item you want. For example, when wanting to craft a weapon, your blacksmith will first of all make all the ingots necessary for that weapon, before crafting the weapon itself.

Your crafters also communicate between each other. So when your carpenter needs a bolt of cloth, your weaver will craft one.

Happy crafting!
